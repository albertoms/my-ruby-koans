# My Ruby Koans

## To-dos

Whenever I find something I don't quite understand I leave a comment using the syntax:

```
# to-do: ...
```

So I can keep going with my [_path to enlightment_](koans#the-path-to-enlightenment),  but leaving a breadcrumb for things that I should check out after. Maybe I'll need to do some research on the web to solve those to-dos.
