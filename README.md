# My Ruby Koans

To see current progress, I should call the file `path_to_enlightenment.rb` while ih the koans directory:

```
~/my-ruby-koans/koans $ ruby path_to_enlightenment.rb
```

Otherwise I'd get path errors.

## To-dos

Whenever I find something I don't quite understand I leave a comment using the syntax:

```
# to-do: ...
```

So I can keep going with my [_path to enlightment_](koans#the-path-to-enlightenment) and helping my future self leaving a breadcrumb for things that I should look at after. Maybe I'll need to do some research on the web to solve those to-dos.

## Note to self

I like to leave quick notes about the things I learned in some particular lesson. I'm using comments wth the format:

```
# NTS:
# Some valuable lesson or nice trick learned.
```
